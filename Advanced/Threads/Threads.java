/*
A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed.
Generally, all the programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, that is
provided by the JVM or Java Virtual Machine at the starting of the programâ€™s execution.
At this point, when the main thread is provided, the main() method is invoked by the main thread.

/*
In Java, multithreading is the method of running two or more threads
at the same time to maximize CPU utilization.  As a result, it is
often referred to as Concurrency in Java. Each thread runs in parallel
with the others. Since several threads do not assign different memory areas,
they conserve memory. Furthermore, switching between threads takes less time.
