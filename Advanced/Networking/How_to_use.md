To establish a connection between the Server and the Client applications, follow these steps:

    Begin by launching the Server application.
    Open another terminal or command prompt to run the Client application.
    Once the Client application starts running, you will see a message indicating a successful connection, such as "Connected."
    The Server application will accept the client and display a message like "Client accepted."
    At this point, you can start entering messages in the Client window.
    The Server application will receive these messages in real-time and display them accordingly.
    To terminate the connection between the Client and the Server, you can type the word "Over" in the Client window.

By following these instructions, you can establish communication between the Server and the Client applications.
